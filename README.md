Added StreamUp seems to work withouthany issue!  
Added Source Profiler! Works!  
Added Image Reaction! Works!

Tried to solve the whole onnxruntime thing. tested it on on flatpak onend even there they conflicted.  
They wantedtheir own version but system gives back the first onnxruntim the first plugin loads and if thats not the latest version the other plugin deosnt load.

What needs to be solved:

- RetroEffects: blank screen
- Onnxruntime conflict

### 2026-04-13

Added retro effects, first the shader files was not found by the plugin i solved that, now it just blank/black screen... yet if i use non flatpkversio it works...  
I really want the flatpak version to work...

Also got some help on Shadertastic stuff...

```txt
you can force fetchcontent to be offline and figure out where to put the downloaded sources.

<https://github.com/flathub/org.freedesktop.LinuxAudio.Plugins.jc303/blob/branch/25.08/org.freedesktop.LinuxAudio.Plugins.jc303.json#L19>

this is an example
the cmake documentation is objecting against FETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED for that situation
<https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html#variable:FETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED>
```

### 2026-04-12

SourceCopy has been added to flathub so thisisnt needed anymore! \o/
Deleting it with this commit!

Shadertasticworks it just has  some conflicts...
has Dependency issue with LocalVocal about libonnxruntime.... the same isue as localVocal has BackgroudRemoval

`Anyway thank you I will try to Override FetchContent first with OVERRIDE_FIND_PACKAGE if its possible if its not  then i need to figure something else out.`

### 2026-04-11

Added Noise. And it works!

Added Shadertastic. It builds but it adds it stuff to the wrong location.
Can I makea custom CmakeList.txt?

### 2026-04-10

Tried building ClosedCaption in flatpak context but could not make it happen.
But the work around works: <https://github.com/ratwithacompiler/OBS-captions-plugin/issues/155#issuecomment-3498925450>

WorkingLocal Vocal but has some issues with BackgroudRemoval...

LocalVocal has some more issues...
If I try to use the included build.sh  it builds, but the plugin never shows up in OBS.
If I dont use it but  call the builder myself only generic builds nvdia gest the following error:

```log
❯ ./build.sh LocalVocal
